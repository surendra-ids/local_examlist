This plugin presents the user a consolidated list of all the quizzes that he has to attempt form the courses that he has been enrolled.\
Now he/she has not to go to all the courses individually and directly pick the list from a link in the left navigation.

This plugin's link can be only visible in boost based themes or themes that have the flat navigation on the left.

Feel free to post bugs at the github page of this plugin.
